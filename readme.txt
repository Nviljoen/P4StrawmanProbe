Very simple strawman example of using Netronome's P4/C integrated environment
At this point in time it doesn't do much but measure a few counters and rough
interarrival times. The Paxos Code is far more extensive-so I would check
that out at the open-nfp repo if you want more solid examples. 

Things to note here though are the use of mailboxes to debug registers and 
a lot of the comments are informative-this is more for learning than for
implementation.

email me at nick.viljoen (at) netronome.com if ypu have any questions/want to
know more.
